Project assumptions
Project was created in ReactJS - to launch it, please follow steps listed below:
 
Step 1:
git clone [repository url]

Step 2:
cd [local repository]

Step 3:
//Check package.json file and ensure scripts are notated as below:

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  
Step 4: 
Delete the node_modules folder and any 'lock' files such as 
yarn.lock or package-lock.json if present.

Step 5: 
npm install

Step 6:
npm start
To Note: There can be some conflict between yarn and npm when cloning from certain repositories. It's best to assume that every repo may need trimming before ultimately running npm install.
